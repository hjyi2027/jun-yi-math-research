# Taylor Series and Convergence

This project explores how Taylor series can be used to approximate functions, how convergence works, and where Taylor approximation succeed or fail.

## 1. Introduction
Taylor series are approximation that allows us to turn non-polynomial functions into polynomial functions using its deratives.


## 2. Definitions and Basics
- Taylor series formula
- Radius of convergence
- Example: Taylor series for eˣ, sin(x), ln(1+x)

## 3. Visualization and Error
- How the approximation improves with higher-degree polynomials
- Graphs comparing function vs. Taylor approximation
- Error term (briefly)

## 4. Deeper Questions
- Why does the Taylor series of ln(x) fail at x=0?
- What happens outside the radius of convergence?

## 5. Python/Desmos Simulation (Optional)
- Plot f(x) and its Taylor approximations for eˣ or sin(x)

## 6. Reflection
- What did I learn?
- Why is this interesting?

## 7. References
- Link to notes, videos, or books you used
