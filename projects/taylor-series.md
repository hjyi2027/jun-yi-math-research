# Taylor Series and Convergence

This project explores how Taylor series can be used to approximate functions, the concept of convergence, and the limits of such approximations.

## 1. Introduction

A Taylor series expresses a function as an infinite sum of its derivatives at a single point. It's a powerful tool in calculus for approximating functions and analyzing their behavior.
