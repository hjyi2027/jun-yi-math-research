# Taylor Series and Convergence

## 1. Introduction
Brief explanation of what a Taylor series is and why it's important.

## 2. Definitions and Basics
- Taylor series formula
- Radius of convergence
- Example: Taylor series for eˣ, sin(x), ln(1+x)

## 3. Visualization and Error
- How the approximation improves with higher-degree polynomials
- Graphs comparing function vs. Taylor approximation
- Error term (briefly)

## 4. Deeper Questions
- Why does the Taylor series of ln(x) fail at x=0?
- What happens outside the radius of convergence?

## 5. Python/Desmos Simulation (Optional)
- Plot f(x) and its Taylor approximations for eˣ or sin(x)

## 6. Reflection
- What did I learn?
- Why is this interesting?
